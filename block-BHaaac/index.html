<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Hello educators of this globe! Iâ€™m V, the 14-year-old 9th-grade student living in Seattle, WA, America. My mom and dad are both Ethiopian immigrants who have taken conflicts with their training. My mom never got the chance to learn anything past that fifth grade. And although my dad was able to achieve his college diploma, he had to quit getting to school after sixth grade because of the struggle going on in him. He then resumed his education in Ethiopia some years after, as the 21-year-old. Training is as valuable to both of them, as they need me to get access to more opportunities than they did in my years.</p>
