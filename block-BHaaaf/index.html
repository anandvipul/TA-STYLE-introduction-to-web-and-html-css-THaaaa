<p>
 There are multiple ways of targeting elements that needs to be styled.
	- Using type selector, in which element tags are directly targeted.
	- using Class selector, derived from the object oriented, class attribute is used to group similar purpose tags, hence it can be used to select elements.
	- id selectors are used when targeting one specific element, as each id should be unique.

Type, Class and Id are three types of selectors. Id selectors are more specific among all.

<p class="out-of-box">
There is no limitation on how the css selectors will be interpreted, as there has been many custom browsers that are being used for dedicated purposes.
